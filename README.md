# COSC499
A repository for my capstone class and associated work.

For this individual github exercise, I'm going to create a very simple version of a complex number calculator that is capable of addition, and subtraction.

The inputs are a ComplexNumber object, into either the add or subtract method. The ComplexNumber object itself is made up of a real number, and an imaginary number.



Unfortunately I was having some issues with getting my program to run properly. I usually code on my desktop but I had to travel this weekend and wasn't able to complete this assignment before I had left. I'm having some issues with my VsCode but I'm sure the code itself works. But due to my laziness and procrastinating starting this assignment until the last day, I didn't leave enough time for myself to troubleshoot these issues nor get around to making any J Tests. Which, understandably will lose me some marks and also leave my video without a lot to cover.
